# DeepNN
Deep neural networks models and methods including CNN, GAN (with conv) and fully connected networks. 
Working with images and tabular data.

## GAN_ConvTranspose.py
Building a deep convolutional GAN and running it with the MNIST dataset to generate fake digits. 

## MNIST_digit_CNN.py
Building a CNN and run the MNIST dataset on it.

## TL_cifar10_resnet.py
Utilized CIFAR10 dataset, while taking only 8 classses out of 10 and analyzed it using Resnet18 and transfer learning while changing the net number of classes.

## TL_tabular_data.py
Utilized Indian Liver Patient Records dataset to examine the FC layer number impact by using transfer learning of FC layers and Tensorboard.
